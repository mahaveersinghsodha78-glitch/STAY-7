# HotelApp — Starter (Backend + Frontend + Panels)

This archive contains a starter hotel booking system:
- backend (Spring Boot + JPA)
- user frontend (static HTML/CSS/JS) — can be served from Spring Boot static folder
- hotel-panel (React/Vite) — small owner panel
- admin-panel (React/Vite) — small admin panel

See the `backend/` folder for how to run the Spring Boot app. For React panels, run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

This is a starter template — not production-ready. Add JWT, BCrypt, payment gateway, validations, image uploads, and proper date-range booking checks for production use.
